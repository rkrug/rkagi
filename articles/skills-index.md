## kagiPro Skills Index

This folder contains AI-agent skills for working with `kagiPro`.
Preferred high-level project workflow:
[`kagi_fetch()`](https://rkrug.github.io/kagiPro/reference/kagi_fetch.md).

### Skills

- `maintainer-workflow` Use when updating package behavior, tests, docs,
  release metadata, or cassettes.
- `maintainer-corpus-pipeline` Use when changing
  [`download_content()`](https://rkrug.github.io/kagiPro/reference/download_content.md),
  [`content_markdown()`](https://rkrug.github.io/kagiPro/reference/content_markdown.md),
  [`markdown_abstract()`](https://rkrug.github.io/kagiPro/reference/markdown_abstract.md),
  summarizer providers, or abstract-link contracts.
- `maintainer-release-sync` Use before release/merge to synchronize
  versioning, changelog, docs, vignettes, and skills.
- `r-package-maintainer` Generic R-package maintainer baseline skill
  (portable across repos) for workflow, validation, branch governance,
  and commit standards.
- `user-search` Use for Search endpoint workflows aligned with
  `vignettes/search-endpoint.qmd`.
- `user-enrich` Use for Enrich endpoint workflows aligned with
  `vignettes/enrich-endpoint.qmd`.
- `user-summarize` Use for Summarize endpoint workflows aligned with
  `vignettes/summarize-endpoint.qmd`.
- `user-fastgpt` Use for FastGPT endpoint workflows aligned with
  `vignettes/fastgpt-endpoint.qmd`.
- `user-corpus-workflow` Use for the full corpus pipeline aligned with
  `vignettes/corpus-workflow.qmd`.

### Selection Rule

1.  If the task is endpoint-specific, choose the corresponding `user-*`
    skill.
2.  If the task changes package internals, tests, release docs, or
    conventions, use `maintainer-workflow`.
3.  If the task changes corpus pipeline internals, use
    `maintainer-corpus-pipeline` (and `maintainer-workflow` when broader
    API/docs are affected).
4.  If the task is release-finalization, use `maintainer-release-sync`.
5.  If the task is generic/package-governance work (not package-specific
    internals), use `r-package-maintainer`.
6.  If a task spans endpoint usage and package changes, load the
    relevant maintainer skill plus the matching `user-*` skill.

### Non-goal

These skills do not replace package docs. They encode actionable
workflows and guardrails for coding agents.

### Branch Policy (Maintainer)

- Long-lived branches are `main` and `dev`.
- `dev` must remain on origin after pull request merges.
- No branch deletion unless explicitly requested and explicitly
  confirmed by the user.
