> R client for the [Kagi API](https://help.kagi.com/kagi/api/).

## Overview

`kagiPro` provides a lightweight R interface to the **Kagi API**, including:

- **Search API** — perform web searches with advanced operators
- **Enrich API** — get higher-signal results from specialized indices
- **Universal Summarizer** — summarize text or URLs in one call
- **FastGPT API** — ask grounded LLM questions with optional web context

The package follows the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org) style for API clients:

- S3 classes for **connections**, **requests**, and **results**
- Extractor helpers to work with results as tibbles or text
- Secure API key handling with [keyring](https://cran.r-project.org/package=keyring)
- Replay metadata for query-by-name reruns in project workflows

## Installation

```r
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rkrug/kagiPro")
```

---

## Authentication

You need a [Kagi account](https://kagi.com) with API access (paid plan).  
Store your API key securely in your system keychain:

```r
# Run once to save your key in the keychain
keyring::key_set("API_kagi")
```

The package will resolve the key at request time with:

```r
conn <- kagi_connection(
  api_key  = function() keyring::key_get("API_kagi")
)
```

---

## Example

```r
library(kagiPro)

# Build a query
q <- query_search(
  query    = 'biodiversity "annual report"',
  filetype = "pdf",
  site     = "example.com",
  expand   = FALSE
)

# Execute request and write JSON output
conn <- kagi_connection(api_key = function() keyring::key_get("API_kagi"))
out <- tempfile("kagiPro-search-")
dir.create(out, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)

kagi_request(
  connection = conn,
  query = q,
  limit = 3,
  output = out,
  overwrite = TRUE
)
```

## Project-Folder Workflow (`kagi_fetch`)

For project-oriented runs aligned with `openalexPro`, use `kagi_fetch()` as the
high-level entrypoint. It writes endpoint-scoped folders:

- `<project_folder>/<endpoint>/json`
- `<project_folder>/<endpoint>/parquet`

```r
library(kagiPro)

conn <- kagi_connection(api_key = function() keyring::key_get("API_kagi"))
q <- query_search("biodiversity policy", expand = FALSE)

parquet_path <- kagi_fetch(
  connection = conn,
  query = q,
  project_folder = "kagi_project"
)
```

To rerun one stored query by name (and refresh only that parquet query
partition), use `kagi_update_query()`:

```r
kagi_update_query(
  connection = conn,
  project_folder = "kagi_project",
  query_name = "query_1"
)
```

To reclaim space from JSON request payloads while keeping rerun metadata, use:

```r
clean_request("kagi_project", dry_run = TRUE)   # preview
clean_request("kagi_project", dry_run = FALSE)  # execute
```

## OpenAlexPro Bridge

For abstract enrichment, use the modular pipeline:
download content -> extract markdown -> summarize markdown.

```r
# Assumes `kagi_project/search/parquet` already exists
download_content(
  project_folder = "kagi_project",
  endpoint = "search"
)

content_markdown(
  project_folder = "kagi_project",
  endpoint = "search"
)

markdown_abstract(
  project_folder = "kagi_project",
  endpoint = "search",
  summarizer_fn = summarize_with_openai,
  model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
)

# Abstract parquet is written under:
# kagi_project/search/abstract/query=<query_name>/
```
